Acme Corp. is negotiating a multi-billion dollar acquisition and wants to conduct due diligence by
placing all the relevant documents in a virtual Data Room. A Data Room is an organized
repository for securely storing and distributing documents. You can take inspiration from Google
Drive, Dropbox, Box, etc., for UI/UX where the Data Room is the top-level folder or drive.
Our goal is for you to develop a Data Room Software MVP that works well out of the box. We ask that
you optimize for (in this order):

- User experience and functionality
- Design and polish
- Code quality and readability

Technical Requirements

- Build a Dataroom frontend single page application,
- We will use React / TypeScript / Tailwind/ Shadcn
- Users can create Datarooms and upload files
- Make use of good data structures to store metadata and state, designed to support functional
  requirements
- Handle edge cases, ex: uploading files with the same name etc
- Create granular react components

Functional Requirements
Main CRUD functionality you should build for

● Folders:

- Create a folder and can nest folders in another folder
- View folders and their contents, this includes nested files and folders
- Update the folder name
- Delete a folder and its nested folders and files

● Files:

- Upload a file, you can support only pdf files for now and can store it in browser memory
  (mock)
- View file in UI
- Update a files name
- Delete a file
